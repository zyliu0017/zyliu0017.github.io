    notes: | 
      Accurate forest inventory management necessitates precise reference data collected at the individual tree level, including the spatial location of each reference tree
      In this project, we aim to develop an efficient and accurate methodology with submeter-level accuracy for measuring the position at individual tree level for forest plots
      by using ultra-wideband distance (UWB) and angle measurements, initial data, and advanced data processing methods. A positioning prototype namely Hotspot with a UWB base station
      and a UWB tag will be developed, which is sufficient to improve the measurement efficiency for the positions of trees by up to 80% and allow for a fivefold test measurement
      at the same expense compared to conventional field measures. Our preliminary results showed that the new method could provide at par the accuracy of current manual field measurements,
      but could be 5-10 times faster. The academic breakthrough will be significantly creating pioneering work in the quality-related forest mapping technologies that are hopefully providing
      strong impacts to Finnish economy in the long run.
